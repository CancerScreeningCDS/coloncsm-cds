#### Purpose

The primary purpose of this implementation guide is to provide guidance
to healthcare organizations regarding how to implement and operate the
CDS tools for colorectal cancer screening and management (CRCSM) in their EHR
and evaluate their performance. In support of this activity, the
document provides a description of the following areas:

-   CRCSM guidelines that informed the development of the CDS service and
    application displays
-   CRCSM integration with the clinical workflow to support patient care
-   CDS design approach and dashboard display
-   Semi-structured (i.e., human readable) logic, also referred to as
    Level 2 (L2) logic
-   Structured (i.e., coded) logic, also referred to as Level 3 (L3)
    logic

#### Scope

This document provides guidance for end-users and implementors of CDS
tools for colorectal cancer screening and management (CRCSM) guidelines. It
includes information about the project background, CDS design details,
EHR integration, and use in a clinical setting.

#### Audience

Various audiences may find the information in this implementation guide
helpful, including:

-   **Clinicians, Quality Improvement Leaders and Health
    Administrators** at healthcare organizations and primary care
    practices who wish to implement, test, and execute CDS related to
    CRCSM in their health IT systems.
-   **CDS Developers and Informaticists** who may use components of this
    CDS logic as a foundation for other preventive health CDS, or who
    want to use well-developed structured logic and CQL in their own
    work.
-   **Community-based** **Organizations** interested in using CRCSM CDS
    tools to promote health and the importance of colorectal
    cancer screening and follow-up.
-   **Health IT Administrators** interested in understanding how the
    CRCSM CDS tools are specified to inform implementation of the CDS in
    their IT system.
